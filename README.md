# Rust Project README
This Rust project is a part of a larger library called libSTARK which is used for building scalable and transparent cryptographic proofs of computation. The specific module contained in this project is the BairWitness module.

## BairWitness
The BairWitness module provides an implementation of the Bair Witness scheme which is used in the construction of STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge). A STARK is a proof system for computation that is both efficient and highly scalable. It achieves this by using efficient low-degree testing and interpolation techniques.

The BairWitness module provides a Rust implementation of the Bair Witness scheme which can be used in the construction of STARKs. It provides an interface for creating a Bair Witness object, adding polynomial values to the object, and extracting polynomial values from the object.

##Interacting with other Libraries
The BairWitness module interacts with other libraries in the libSTARK library. Specifically, it interacts with the algebraLib and languages modules which provide the algebraic and language abstractions used in the construction of STARKs.

The algebraLib module provides an implementation of finite fields and field extensions which are used in the Bair Witness scheme. The languages module provides an implementation of the arithmetic circuit language which is used to specify the computations being proven.

Overall, the BairWitness module is just one part of the larger libSTARK library which provides a comprehensive set of tools for constructing STARKs.
